## Attribution Note

These exercises have been shamelessly copied from the R-Primers project created
by [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/). The original version of Heiss'
website is available [here](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/index.html).

```{r include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.height = 6 * 0.618,
  fig.retina = 3,
  dev = "ragg_png",
  fig.align = "center",
  out.width = "70%"
)

```

The at-home portion of this week's practical exercises will introduce you to the
rudements of data visualization and statistical programming in R.
