# R-Primers

## Attribution Note

This project is a blatant clone of the R-Primers project created by
[Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/). The original version of this website
is available [here](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/index.html).

 I'm hosting my own copy of these materials for three reasons:

1. So I can modify the deployment workflow to serve the site from GitHub Pages.
1. To tweak the tutorial structure to better suit my teaching needs.
1. To ensure that the content of the tutorials doesn't change in the middle
of a course in which I'm relying on this resource.

If you've somehow stumbled onto this page in the wild, and you think you can
benefit from my modifications to Heiss' work, feel free to take/use/modify
any part of this project (so long as you honor the [licensing requirements](/LICENSE.md)).
Otherwise, you should probably use Heiss' original version of this project.
